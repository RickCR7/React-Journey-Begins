## Vite or Parcel -> Bundler

## React is a library of JS

## react + react-dom -> Website Applications

## react + react-native -> Mobile Applications

## npx 
-> node package executer

## create-react-app 
-> utility or software (Bulky utility)

## Disadvantages of React
1. SEO
2. Routing

## React is fast beacuasae it builds Single Page Application(SPA)

## JSX elements/components should start with a uppercase letter

##<></> -> Fragments

## UI 
-> Should be handled by react not by us

## React react karta hai variable updation pe

## Hooks 
-> Special methods provided by react 

## We can pass any value inside the useState hooks parenthesis

## React does not use virtual DOM as of today.

## React Fiber(Latest approach)
-> React fiber is a reimplementation of React's core algorithm

## The goal of React Fiber 
-> is to increase its suitability for areas like animation, layout, and gestures. Its headline feature is incremental rendering: the ability to split rendering work into chunks and spread it out over multiple frames.

## Other key features include :
The ability to pause, abort, or reuse work as new updates come in; the ability to assign priority to different types of updates; and new concurrency primitives.

## Reconcilation:
The algorithm react uses to diff one tree with another to determine which part to be changed.

## 'setState' eventually results in a re-render

## Tailwind CSS : 
A utility-first CSS framework

## devui.io

## useCallback:
useCallback is a React Hook that lets you cache a function definition between re-renders.

### Reference:
* useCallback(fn, dependencies) *

### Usage:
1. Skipping re-rendering of components
2. Updating state from a memoized callback
3. Preventing an Effect from firing too often
4. Optimizing a custom Hook
