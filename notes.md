#### 1. Vite or Parcel -> Bundler

#### 2. React is a library of JS

#### 3. 
 * react + react-dom -> Website Applications
 * react + react-native -> Mobile Applications


## 4. npx 
-> node package executer

## 5. create-react-app 
-> utility or software (Bulky utility)

## 6. Disadvantages of React
1. SEO
2. Routing

#### 7. React is fast beacuasae it builds Single Page Application(SPA)

#### 8. JSX elements/components should start with a uppercase letter

#### 9. <></> -> Fragments

## 10. UI 
-> Should be handled by react not by us

#### 11. React react karta hai variable updation pe

## 12. Hooks 
-> Special methods provided by react 

####  13. We can pass any value inside the useState hooks parenthesis

#### 14. React does not use virtual DOM as of today.

## 15. React Fiber(Latest approach)
-> React fiber is a reimplementation of React's core algorithm

* The goal of React Fiber is to increase its suitability for areas like animation, layout, and gestures. Its headline feature is incremental rendering: the ability to split rendering work into chunks and spread it out over multiple frames.

* Other key features include :
The ability to pause, abort, or reuse work as new updates come in; the ability to assign priority to different types of updates; and new concurrency primitives.

### 16. Reconcilation:
The algorithm react uses to diff one tree with another to determine which part to be changed.

#### 17. 'setState' eventually results in a re-render

## 18. Tailwind CSS : 
A utility-first CSS framework

## 19. devui.io

### 20. useCallback:
useCallback is a React Hook that lets you cache a function definition between re-renders.

#### Reference:
* useCallback(fn, dependencies) 

#### Usage:
1. Skipping re-rendering of components
2. Updating state from a memoized callback
3. Preventing an Effect from firing too often
4. Optimizing a custom Hook
